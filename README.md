## Quizlet Math Terms

1. **Definition of sides**  
   - Typically refers to the lengths of the boundaries in geometrical shapes.

2. **Distributive Property**  
   - \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \)

3. **Order of Operations**  
   - PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction)

4. **Adjacent angles**  
   - Angles that share a common vertex and side but don't overlap.

5. **Vertical angles**  
   - Pair of opposite angles formed by intersecting lines.

6. **Solving single variable equations**  
   - \( ax = b \) becomes \( x = \frac{b}{a} \)

7. **Supplementary angles**  
   - Two angles that add up to 180 degrees.

8. **Corresponding angles**  
   - Angles in matching corners when two lines are cut by a transversal.

9. **Alternate exterior angles**  
   - Angles on opposite sides of a transversal but outside the parallel lines, and are equal.

10. **Exterior angles**  
    - Angles formed outside parallel lines when intersected by a transversal.

11. **Transversal on angles**  
    - A line that intersects two or more lines at distinct points.

12. **Congruent angles**  
    - Angles that have the same measure.

13. **Complete the circle**  
    - Often refers to creating a 360-degree angle or completing a task.

14. **Mental math techniques**  
    - Strategies like rounding, breaking numbers down, or using multiplication tables for quick calculations.
